# deno-google-auth
This is best run in the Deno Deploy environment. You'll need to set these Deploy Environment Variables:
* ALLOWED_EMAILS (comma separated list of emails to allow, we don't want just any gmail user in do we?)
* BASE_URL (the URL of your Deno Project)
* GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID (from your Google Console)
* GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET (from same place)
